# Arduino Collegue Projects

In this repository you can find projects developed by me in the computer systems discipline of the web information systems and technologies course.
Here you will find the resolution of several embedded systems, using the Arduino Uno, which is considered ideal for beginners.

The programming language used in these projects is C++, to use it you will need a compiler, because it is not interpreted, but there is no problem, arduino offers a [free editor](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

## Lessons Learned

What did I learn while building these projects? What challenges did I faced and how did I overcome them?

- Throughout these challenges, I got to learn:
    - To master the C++ languague and develop my programming skills;
    - I learned basic knowledge and fundamentals regarding electricity and electronics.
    - Developed problem solving skills, in terms of detecting flaws in the system.
    - And I got to create cool projects.
## Roadmap

- TurnON_LED (Basic Project)

- Control_led_with_loop

- Control_led_timer

- Control_led_pwm

- Stop_Light 

- Control_led_with_2buttons

After this little roadmap, my suggestion is for you to go out and have fun while attempting these projects. I'll be posting more exercises and projects in the future, so stay tuned.

## Installation

Install Arduino IDE on Linux with Install Script

- After downloading the folder containing the ide extract it then run.

```bash
  sudo sh install.sh
```
- You can see the following steps right [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/Linux).
